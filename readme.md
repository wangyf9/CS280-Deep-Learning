- [HW1](https://github.com/wangyf9/CS280-Deep-Learning/tree/main/CS280-Fall24-Assignment1)
  - GMM
  - Perceptron learning
  - Softmax
  - K-Neareast Neighbor(KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine(SVM)
  - Neural Network(NN)
  - Image Feature tasks
- [HW2](https://github.com/wangyf9/CS280-Deep-Learning/tree/main/CS280-Fall24-Assignment2)
  - Style Transfer
  - GAN

## Environment Set up

Each assigment has a `requirements.txt`, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` at main directory can help you prepare for your conda environment. If error, maybe you need to consider about your python version, 
because cs231n's been around for years, using too many old version packages. Therefore, pay attention to your dependencies.

## Quiz

Many Quizs are old questiones, so you can refer to [ItechX](https://i-techx.github.io/iTechX/courses?course_code=CS280) to get some details.
 For those new questions, you can refer to your ppts, such as Stable Diffusion, DDIM, etc. Not only can you learn about the formulas, but also you can know when and where to apply them.
